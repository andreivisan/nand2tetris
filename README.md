## Boolean Functions

f(x, y, z) = (x AND y) OR (NOT(x) AND z)

### Commutative Laws

(x AND y) = (y AND x)
(x OR y) = (y OR x)

### Associative Laws

(x AND (y AND z)) = ((x AND y) AND z)
(x OR (y OR z)) = ((x OR y) OR z)

### Distributive Laws

(x AND (y OR z)) = (x AND y) OR (x AND z)
(x OR (y AND z)) = (x OR y) AND (x OR z)

### De Morgan Laws

NOT(x AND y) = NOT(x) OR NOT(y)
NOT(x OR y) = NOT(x) AND NOT(y)

## Boolean Functions Synthesis

This basically means Truth Table to Boolean Function (expression).
